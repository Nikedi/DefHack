ü§ñ DefHack LLM-Based Message Classification System
==================================================

MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:

üìã OLD SYSTEM (Keyword-Based):
  ‚Ä¢ Simple keyword matching (e.g., "mre", "ammo", "broken")
  ‚Ä¢ Couldn't detect context or nuance
  ‚Ä¢ Missed complex expressions
  ‚Ä¢ Poor banter detection
  ‚Ä¢ Fixed keyword lists in multiple languages

üß† NEW SYSTEM (LLM-Based):
  ‚Ä¢ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini analyzes full message context
  ‚Ä¢ Intelligent classification into 4 categories:
    - BANTER: Casual conversation, jokes, personal complaints
    - LOGISTICS: Supply requests, equipment needs, fuel, ammo
    - SUPPORT: Maintenance, repairs, medical assistance
    - TACTICAL: Enemy activity, threats, intelligence

üîÑ INTEGRATION POINT:
  Classification happens during JSON conversion in enhanced_processor.py
  where raw Telegram messages are processed into structured observations.

üìä PROCESSING FLOW:
  1. Raw message received ‚Üí enhanced_processor.py
  2. LLM analyzes message and classifies type
  3. Creates ProcessedObservation with message_type field
  4. integrated_system.py routes based on LLM classification:
     - BANTER ‚Üí Ignored completely
     - LOGISTICS ‚Üí Database storage with "LOGISTICS:" prefix
     - SUPPORT ‚Üí Database storage with "SUPPORT:" prefix  
     - TACTICAL ‚Üí Leader notifications + database storage

‚úÖ BENEFITS:
  ‚Ä¢ More accurate banter detection (no more "I want home" alerts)
  ‚Ä¢ Better logistics/support classification
  ‚Ä¢ Handles complex expressions and context
  ‚Ä¢ Adaptable without code changes
  ‚Ä¢ Processes multiple languages naturally
  ‚Ä¢ Reduces false positives significantly

üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS:
  ‚Ä¢ LLM prompt engineered for military context
  ‚Ä¢ Classification embedded in observation data structure
  ‚Ä¢ Backwards compatible with existing notification system
  ‚Ä¢ Uses existing OpenAI integration
  ‚Ä¢ Processes during message-to-JSON conversion phase

üìù EXAMPLE CLASSIFICATIONS:
  "lol that's funny" ‚Üí BANTER (ignored)
  "I'm bored and tired" ‚Üí BANTER (ignored)
  "We're running low on MREs for the mission" ‚Üí LOGISTICS (database)
  "Radio needs maintenance before patrol" ‚Üí SUPPORT (database)
  "Enemy movement spotted in sector 7" ‚Üí TACTICAL (leader alerts)

üöÄ SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING
