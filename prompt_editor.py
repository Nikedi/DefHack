2. BTG DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS
   - Apply Russian BTG doctrine from available intelligence documents [D:5][D:6]
   - Compare observed activities to expected BTG deployment patterns
   - Assess BTG phase of operations (reconnaissance, deployment, attack)
   - Identify deviations from doctrine and tactical implications

3. THREAT ANALYSIS BY WARFIGHTING FUNCTION
   - MOVEMENT & MANEUVER: Observed repositioning, tactical formations
   - INTELLIGENCE: Enemy reconnaissance and surveillance signatures  
   - FIRES: Indirect fire preparation, target acquisition activities
   - PROTECTION: Defensive measures, force protection indicators
   - SUSTAINMENT: Logistics signatures, supply line activities
   - COMMAND & CONTROL: Communications patterns, leadership movements

4. PATTERN ANALYSIS
   - TEMPORAL: Activity timing, operational rhythm, peak periods
   - SPATIAL: Geographic clustering, axes of advance, defensive positions
   - TACTICAL: Force ratios, equipment types, capability indicators

5. ENEMY COURSES OF ACTION
