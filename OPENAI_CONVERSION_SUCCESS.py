- Different prompt structure
- Separate model configuration

AFTER (OpenAI):
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Same API key as your DefHack system
- Optimized military prompts
- Consistent with your existing setup

FUNCTIONALITY REMAINS THE SAME:
‚úÖ Automatic tactical message analysis
‚úÖ MGRS coordinate extraction
‚úÖ Sensor reading generation
‚úÖ Group chat monitoring
‚úÖ /frago and /intrep commands
‚úÖ Location sharing support

üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READY:
===================

Your Telegram bot is now fully integrated with OpenAI and ready for deployment:

1. Same tactical capabilities as before
2. Better integration with your DefHack system
3. Unified API management
4. Enhanced military intelligence analysis
5. Cost-effective GPT-4o-mini model usage

üéñÔ∏è MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES:
=====================================

‚úÖ Real-time tactical message analysis using OpenAI
‚úÖ Automatic threat detection and classification
‚úÖ Military terminology and standard designations
‚úÖ Confidence scoring for observations
